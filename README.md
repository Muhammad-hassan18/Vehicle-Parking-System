<h1>Parking System 🚗🚌🏍️🚖</h1>
</br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
This is a Parking System project developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The system allows users to manage parking for different types of vehicles such as Cars, Buses, Motorbikes, and Rickshaws.
</br>
The project is part of a 2nd-semester software engineering course, aiming to demonstrate the application of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.
</br>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add Vehicles: Users can park cars, buses, motorbikes, and rickshaws</li>
<li>Remove Vehicles: Vehicles can be removed from the parking area and appropriate charges will be shown</li>
<li>View Stats: Displays the total number of each vehicle type currently parked</li>
<li>Parking Capacity: The system has a limited capacity for each type of vehicle</li>
</br>
<h3>Concepts Demonstrated</h3>
</br>
<li>Classes and Objects: The system is built around a ParkingSystem class that manages different vehicle types through the use of an array of objects</li>
<li>Encapsulation: Private data members ensure that the internal workings of the parking system are hidden from outside interference</li>
<li>Conditional Logic: The system uses conditional statements to check for the availability of parking spaces and handle different vehicle types</li>
</ul>
